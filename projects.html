<h3>Duck Coin (soon to come)</h3>
        <p>Duck Coin (DKC) is the first cryptocurrency that is not based on the blockchain and on GPU mining. Instead, it is based on CPU mining. It is way easier to mine and needs less energy. It's still being developed though, so you can't download the Duck Coin Client yet (but you'll soon to be able to!)</p>

      <p>The Duck Organization is a series of mini-projects about DUCKS including :
        <br>
        <u>Worship the Duck</u> : a website where you pretty worship a duck a get higher up in the duck clergy
        <br>
        <u>Stroke the Duck</u> : a website where you pet/stroke a duck 
        <br>
        <u>Bouncy Duck</u> (formally known as StuDuck) : a website where you can admire a duck bouncing. But you can also start a session of a set number of bounces. When you start a session bounces are reset to 0, Lo-Fi music starts playing in the background and you can start working/studying. At the end of your session, I recommend going on <a href="https://shitter.ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shitter.ch</a> and writing a post flexing about the length of your working/studying session and the number of times the duck bounced during it
        <br>
        <u>Feed the Duck</u> : a website your feed a duck and see it grow bigger and bigger
