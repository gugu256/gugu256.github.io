### [Duck Organization](https://organization.thedukk.repl.co)


The Duck Organization is a series of mini-projects about DUCKS including :
  

Worship the Duck : a website where you pretty worship a duck a get higher up in the duck clergy
  

Stroke the Duck : a website where you pet/stroke a duck 
  

Bouncy Duck (formally known as StuDuck) : a website where you can admire a duck bouncing. But you can also start a session of a set number of bounces. When you start a session bounces are reset to 0, Lo-Fi music starts playing in the background and you can start working/studying. At the end of your session, I recommend going on [shitter.ch](https://shitter.ch) and writing a post flexing about the length of your working/studying session and the number of times the duck bounced during it
  

Feed the Duck : a website your feed a duck and see it grow bigger and bigger
